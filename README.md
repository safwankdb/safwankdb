Projects are good things, perhaps the best of things. In my experience, no good project ever gets completed. Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects I own or have contributed to. Apart from this, have a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/safwankdb). You can find a short (probably outdated) Resume [here](https://safwankdb.github.io/Resume.pdf).

<h2><a href="https://safwankdb.github.io/blog" style="color: #000000">Blog</a></h2>    

This is my blog [```Segmentation Fault```](https://safwankdb.github.io/blog) where I try to summarize my thoughts about all kinds of things. Having started recently, I will try to write more often.
